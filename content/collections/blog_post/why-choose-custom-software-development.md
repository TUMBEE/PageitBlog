**<h4>What does custom software development involve?</h4>**

Where out-of-the-box software can help businesses handle specific standard processes, custom software development covers a vast swathe of digital projects and is ultimately geared towards assisting companies to meet some of their more targeted requirements.

Where packaged software is essentially ready to go once it's installed and configured, without the need for a specialised IT department, there are several steps to delivering a successful custom software solution. But if you have the time and a little more give in your initial budget, the benefits of custom software development, generally speaking, far outweigh any upfront outlay.


Here at Page It, the custom application development lifecycle typically starts with idea validation and technical feasibility study. Our advice is to always start from an in-depth analysis of your business goals, market trends and technological possibilities. At this point, you can bring on board a team of software experts with R&D and product design skills to help you perform the analysis and build a product prototype based on your requirements and needs.
